## Understanding the sprint guidelines




## Individual Progress
This week went very well, I was able to start working on the actions for listing trips. Finished Get all, get by ID, Add a new list and update list. Actions for listing trips has been completed. I have started researching Stripe, so we can implement it into our project. I have started integrating Stripe into the back-end of our project. I'm not fully finished yet, because I've ran into issues during the process in Postman. Our PM told me to reach out if I don't think I can get it done by Monday.
