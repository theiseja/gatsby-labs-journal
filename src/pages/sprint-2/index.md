## First night
The first night of this sprint week went very well I thought. Our team was able to complete our TDD for our Trip Planner app, and we begun setting things up. We joined the Github organization that was previously setup by our PM Modesto Tamayo. I shortly began building the basic API to get it up and running which went well without any issues.

## Milestone Reflections
Overall I felt this was a very good but calming week. The beginning not so much because of the slight confusion on certain things, but besides all of that we were able to complete MVP for Sprint Week one.
