## Project Planning

Our first sprint was to get together as a team and plan a TDD document for our Trip Planner app.

## First night

I contributed to the TDD along with my teammates, we were brainstorming on which technologies to pick for our app. We tossed around ideas, and through out links to different third party APIs, and frameworks. In the end we decided on React for the frontend and Firestore for the database. We're using node and express for the API itself which I was able to build at a decent pace.

## Milestone Reflections

I feel we did a very good job at planning for the project. Everyone communicated well and still does during the new sprint weeks. We also host zoom calls daily to discuss how things are going, or to ask questions if stuck on something. Our team was able to complete the MVP for Sprint Week One
